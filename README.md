<h1>Hey there! :crescent_moon:</h1>

<b>I'm [Nick](https://www.nickmagidson.com/), a Frontend Engineer based out of Philadelphia, PA.</b> 

I have a heavy focus in React and Next.js. With that, I love diving into DevOps, LLMs, geospatial applications, and space data.

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me writing music, exploring new coffee shops, and collecting way too many planets.

Currently:
- I'm working on my [satellite tracker](https://project-lynx.netlify.app/)
- And contributing to open source projects
