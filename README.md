<h1>Hey there! :crescent_moon:</h1>

<b>I'm [Nick](https://www.nickmagidson.com/), a Frontend Engineer based out of Philadelphia, PA.</b> 

I have a heavy focus in React and Next.js. Other than that, I love diving into DevOps, LLMs, geospatial applications, and space data.

When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me writing music, exploring new coffee shops, and collecting way too many planets.
